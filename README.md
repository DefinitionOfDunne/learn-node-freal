# learn-node-freal

Project Description:

An app that allows users to make an account with the Better Buddy service. Users can create lists of important family and friends, set communication goals for each person listed, receive reminders based on their intended communication goals, and receive weekly summaries based on their "performance" of the previous week.

User Experience:

-User should be able to visit the site and create an account. -User should be able to login in. -User should be able to create a list of family AND a list of friends. -User should be able to add or remove people for these lists at any time. -User should be able to assign goals for communication (phone calls, text, email, social media interaction) for each listed person as a monthly template. -User should be able to check off each communication goal once acheived. -User should receive feedback each week (email?) with a report of percentage communication completed.

NPM Modules:

-Express -nodemon -MongoDB -Mongoose -Mocha -Chai -body-parser -Passport
